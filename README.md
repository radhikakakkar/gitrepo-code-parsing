## Steps to Run the Code

1. Clone the repo
2. Change the absolute paths in two files: `tree_sitter_parsing.py` and `main.py`
3. You'll need a `MONGODB_URI` in a `.env` file
4. You'll need a Firebase credentials file for use in `main.py`

**Please note:** Currently, you can only parse Python code from GitHub repositories.
